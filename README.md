# Data Structure - Linked List

### Implementation of the 4 types of LL's in C++ -
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Singly Linked List
- Circular Doubly Linked List

###### To be able to use these functions, create a main file in the outer directory.
### To include singly linked node and functions of SLL and CSLL,
```c++
#include "header/singlyNode.h"
```

### To include doubly linked node and functions of DLL and CDLL,
```c++
#include "header/doublyNode.h"
```
### The functions are: 
```
-   display()
-   insertAtFront()
-   insertAtEnd()
-   insertAtPosition()
-   deleteFromFront()
-   deleteFromEnd()
-   deleteFromPosition()
```

### To be able to call the requred functions, use respective namespaces: 
|Linked List|Namespace|
|-------|------|
|Singly Linked List|**SLL**|
|Doubly Linked List|**DLL**|
|Circular Singly Linked List|**CSLL**|
|Circular Doubly Linked List|**CDLL**|
